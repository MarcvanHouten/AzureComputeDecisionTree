# Azure Compute Decision Tree

The number of compute options where you can run your application in Azure increased significantly over the last couple of years and the number of options can be overwhelming for a lot of people or organizations that are new to Azure.

On the public Azure documentation website we provide a decision tree (Choosing an Azure compute service - Azure Architecture Center | Microsoft Docs) but this doesn’t include all compute options and it’s very high level. Based on my conversations I tried to build a decision tree that provides a little more guidance. 

This decision tree only includes Azure first party services. A first party Azure service is a service that is delivered and managed by Microsoft. A first party service can be based on third-party technology which Microsoft delivers as an Azure native service. Organizations can also leverage third-party services that can be deployed onto Microsoft Infrastructure Services. These are not included in this decision tree.

Microsoft Azure services rapidly evolve so keep in mind that the information shared in this article can become outdated over time.
